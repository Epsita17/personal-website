            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>At one time or another, as a new developer to this field, I ’ve found myself hopelessly stuck on a coding issue I had to solve. I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me Desperately searching here and there. Finally Programing Hero guided me. Now as a web developer That's why I’m excited to make a big impact at a high growth company. Let’s make something special.There were protest songs of the anti-war and civil rights movements in the 1960s, which created a venue for civil disobedience and influenced the public attitude. Although many denied its negative impact, it enabled an accelerated use of drugs and alcohol among its adherents and fans as they attempted to achieve a stronger connection with the music. Although such usages are viewed as detrimental societal factors, hard rock became a unifying communicational device to show its dual purpose; to bring disparate groups together, and to separate them from social conservatism.There were protest songs of the anti-war and civil rights movements in the 1960s, which created a venue for civil disobedience and influenced the public attitude.
